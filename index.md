I am a NLP researcher, with experience and knowledge in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Analysis, Information Retrieval. I have more than 4 years R&D experience in a research institute in Japan and in Vietnam. I also have programming skills in Python, C/C++, Perl/Ruby and R.

In free time, I love reading, learning Japanese, writing and translating some (I think) useful stuffs on [my blog](https://khmt.wordpress.com/) (in Vietnamese).
